    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset used for this project contains information on a 100thousand patients in Brazil who were booked for medical appointments. It also contains information on whether they showed up or didn't show up for their registered appointment.\n",
    "The dataset was downloaded from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). Each observation is made up 14 attributes collected to help with our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The information collected on each potential patient are as follows;\n",
    "* `PatientId`: Unique number given to identify each patient.\n",
    "* `AppointmentID`: Unique identifier for each registered appointment.\n",
    "* `Gender`: Identifies if a patient is Male or Female.\n",
    "* `ScheduledDay`: Indicates the date on which the appointment was registered.\n",
    "* `AppointmentDay`: Indicates the date booked for the patient's appointment.\n",
    "* `Age`: Represents the patient's age.\n",
    "* `Neighbourhood`: Indicates the area in where the patient lives.\n",
    "* `Scholarship`: Indicates if the patient is enrolled in [Bolsa Familia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%25C3%25ADlia&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1653565044883782&usg=AOvVaw03HnXIAYBEViKyTyu0Pilx) welfare program.\n",
    "* `Hypertenstion`: Signifies if the patient is Hypertensive.\n",
    "* `Diabetes`: Signifies if the patient suffers from diabetes.\n",
    "* `Alcoholism`: Indicates if the patient suffers from alcohol addiction.\n",
    "* `Handicapped`: Signifies if the patient lives with a disability.\n",
    "* `SMS_received`: Indicates if the patient was reminded about their appointment via SMS\n",
    "* `No-Show`: Indicates if the patient did not show up for the appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "> We would be looking to answer some questions and try to find out if these variables can help predict patients showing up for their appointment or not and the other variables provided ;\n",
    "* Which gender has the highest proportion on No-shows ?\n",
    "* Does the day of the week have an effect on No-show ?\n",
    "* Does neighbourhood influence patients showing up or not ?\n",
    "* Is there a relationship between patients on scholarship and showing up for appointments ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore."
